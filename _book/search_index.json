A KD ratio of 1 means that the player got killed exactly as many times as he successfully eliminated his opponents killstreak : kill a number of enemy players without dying. level : is the player grade 3.3 Data Features 2/3 losses : total number of losing prestige: it is an optional Mode that players can choose after they progress to Level 55 and max hits : number of times the player damaged another player timePlayed : the time spent by every player playing Call of Duty in hours headshots : number of times the player hit the others with headshots averageTime : avrage time gamesPlayed : number of times the player plays a match 3.4 Data Features 3/3 assists : number of times player damaging an enemy but a teammate gets the kill. misses : the number of times the player miss the hit xp : Experience Points (XP) are a numerical quantity exclusive to multiplayer that dictates a player’s level and progress in the game. scorePerMinute :a measure of how many points players are gaining per unit time. shots : number of shots the player did deaths : number of time the player gots killed in the game. 3.5 Pearson Correlation First we created a heatmap of correlations to see if there are any patterns that immediately stick out 3.6 Process First step in the scaling process is to decide how many clusters we want generated in the final output K-means algorithm will randomly select k objects from the data to serve as initial centroids Each remaining data points are assigned to its closest centroid as measured by Euclidean distance between each object and the cluster mean Then the algorithm finds the new mean value for each cluster 3.7 Ending the Process Each observation is checked again and reassigned if there is a new closest centroid Process ends when the cluster assignments stop changing The process by which assignments stop changing is called “convergence” 3.8 Cluster Results 3.9 Choosing an Appropriate amount of Clusters Elbow method This method vary the amount of clusters, k, and compute the clustering algorithm Calculate the total within-cluster sum of squares (wss) for each k Plot the curve of wss based on k Where the curve “elbows” or bends significantly is indication of the optimal number of clusters to use for the analysis 3.10 Applying the Elbow Method on our data 3.11 Silhouette Method This method analyzes the quality of clustering Higher average silhouette widths indicate good clustering Similar to the elbow method, this method varies the value of k and finds the value that maximizes the average silhouette "],["conclusion-results.html", "4 Conclusion Results 4.1 Conclusion and Final Results", " 4 Conclusion Results Visualizing the results: 4.1 Conclusion and Final Results In cluster 1, the average number of wins is 59.2 In cluster 2, the average number of wins is 755 Differentiating between Great and Bad Players Could add a 3rd cluster, but it would not be ideal "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
